# Analysis of Decomposition Techniques for Transformers

Transformers were initially designed for natural language processing and have been adapted for image classification through Vision Transformers (ViTs). This project apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ViTs to reduce model complexity and computational demands.
We evaluated different types of ViTs with and without decompositions on the CIFAR-10 and MRI datasets. Results showed that SVD and PCA reduce training time with a trade-off in accuracy.
